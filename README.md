I am a Ph.D. student in [Mechatronic Enginneering](https://www.engineering.unsw.edu.au/study-with-us/undergraduate-degrees/mechatronic-engineering) in [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/) since 2016. My research interest includes computer vision, 3D object detection, SLAM, and robotics, and the thesis name is *object detection for intelligent robots in urban contexts*. My Ph.D. advisor is [Dr. Jose Guivant](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=_4IB14IAAAAJ&hl=en). I obtained my bachelor and master degreee from [Wuhan University of Technology](http://english.whut.edu.cn/) in 2013 and 2016.
